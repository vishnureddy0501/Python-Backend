1. Basic SQL Queries
    SELECT statements: Retrieving specific columns or all columns using SELECT *.
    Filtering data: Using WHERE, AND, OR, BETWEEN, LIKE, etc.
    Sorting results: Using ORDER BY.
    Limiting results: Using LIMIT or OFFSET.
    Aliases: Renaming tables or columns using AS.

2. Joins
    INNER JOIN: Combining rows where there's a match between two tables.
    LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Retrieving all records from the left table and matching ones from the right table.
    RIGHT JOIN: Similar to LEFT JOIN but in reverse.
    FULL JOIN: Retrieving all records when there is a match in either table.
    Self-joins: Joining a table to itself.
3. Aggregations and Grouping
    GROUP BY: Grouping rows that have the same values in specified columns.
    Aggregate functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN().
    HAVING: Filtering groups after applying GROUP BY.
4. Subqueries
5. Set Operations
    UNION: Combining results of two or more queries and removing duplicates.
    UNION ALL: Similar to UNION, but retains duplicates.
    INTERSECT: Returning only the common rows between two queries.
    EXCEPT (or MINUS): Returning rows from one query that are not in another.
