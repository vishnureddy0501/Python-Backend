select * from Table_name;
select name, id from Table_name;

select queries:
---------------
SELECT * 
FROM CITY 
WHERE POPULATION > 100000 
AND CountryCode = 'USA' AND ID % 2 = 0;

eg: select distinct ones
------------------------
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE ID%2 = 0

find the 2th highest salary:
----------------------------
limit means how many rows we need in our output.
offset means how many rows we need to skip.
offset 2 means skip 2 rows. limit 1 means take only 1 row in output.

select DISTINCT SALARY from Employees ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;

find nth highest salary:
------------------------
select distinct salary from employees order by salary desc limit 1 offset n-1;

sol2:
----
select e1.salary from employees e1 where n-1 = (select count(DISTINCT e2.salary) from employee e2 where e2.salary > e1.salary)

sql queries to find duplicate empid in the table:
------------------------------------------------
output for the both solutions are bit different. but they are valid.

select *, count(empid) from employees group by empid HAVING count(empid) > 1;

(or)

SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE empid IN (
    SELECT empid 
    FROM employees 
    GROUP BY empid 
    HAVING COUNT(empid) > 1
);

write a query to display first record and the last record:
----------------------------------------------------------
select * from employees where empid = (select MIN(empid) from employees where empid);
select * from employees where empid = (select MAX(empid) from employees where empid)
