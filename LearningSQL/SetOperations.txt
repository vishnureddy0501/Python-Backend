1. UNION
Description: The UNION operator combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It removes duplicate rows from the result.
Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table1
    UNION
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table2;
Example: Assume we have two tables, Table_A and Table_B:

Table_A:

id | name
---|-------
1  | Alice
2  | Bob
3  | Charlie

Table_B:

id | name
---|-------
4  | Bob
5  | David

Query:
    SELECT name FROM Table_A
    UNION
    SELECT name FROM Table_B;

Result:
    name
    -------
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie
    David

2. UNION ALL

Description: The UNION ALL operator combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements but retains all duplicate rows.
Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table2;

3. INTERSECT

Description: The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that are common to both queries, effectively finding the intersection of the two result sets.
Syntax:
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table1
    INTERSECT
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table2;

Additional Notes
----------------
    All queries in a UNION, UNION ALL, or INTERSECT must have the same number of columns and corresponding data types in the result sets.
    The column names in the result set are taken from the first SELECT statement.
