 When Explicit Type Conversion Is Required:
 ------------------------------------------
    Concatenating a string with an integer (or performing an operation between incompatible types):
    print("Age: " + str(25))  # You need to convert 25 to a string explicitly
    print(3 + int("2"))       # You need to convert "2" to an integer explicitly
Python doesn't automatically convert between types because this can lead to ambiguity or unintended behavior.
