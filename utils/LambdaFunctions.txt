Lambdas in Python are anonymous functions, meaning they are functions without a name. They are used when you need a simple function for a short period, especially when the function is simple and does not require a full function definition using def. The syntax for a lambda function is different from that of a regular Python function.
Lambda Function Syntax:

python

lambda arguments: expression

    Arguments: Input parameters for the function.
    Expression: A single expression that is evaluated and returned.

Example of a Lambda Function:

python

# Regular function using def
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Equivalent lambda function
add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y

# Using the lambda function
result = add_lambda(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8

Use Cases for Lambda Functions:

    Short, simple functions: Lambdas are used when you need a quick function for a one-time use, such as in sorting, filtering, or mapping operations.

    Anonymous functions: Lambda functions are often passed as arguments to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as input).

Common Use Cases of Lambda Functions:
1. Using Lambda in map():

map() applies a function to all elements in an iterable (like a list).

python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]

2. Using Lambda in filter():

filter() filters elements from an iterable based on a condition.

python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]

3. Using Lambda in sorted() with key:

You can use a lambda function as a key in sorting functions to customize the sorting behavior.

python

students = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 85},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'grade': 92},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'grade': 78},
]
sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student['grade'])
print(sorted_students)
# Output: [{'name': 'Charlie', 'grade': 78}, {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 85}, {'name': 'Bob', 'grade': 92}]
